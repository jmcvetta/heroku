[Go](http://golang.org) client for Heroku API


# Documentation

See GoDoc for [automatically generated documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/jmcvetta/heroku).


# Note

Heroku's published [API docs](http://api-docs.heroku.com) appear to be
outdated, as they do **not** accurately describe the response messages returned
by the API.  It is therefore likely they also do not correctly/fully describe
the possible requests the API can accept.  We are sailing in uncharted waters
here...


# Status

Not yet ready for prime time.
